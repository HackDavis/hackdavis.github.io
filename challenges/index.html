	<b style="font-size: 25px; color: #00accb;"> Teach For America (Education Nonprofit)</b> <br> <br> 

		- Problem #1: Lesson plan review and feedback <br> <br> 

		Teachers often want to have their plans reviewed and receive feedback to make sure their kids are getting the best lesson possible. However, this often doesn't happen due to a lack of time/resources from admin or instructional coaches. It would be great to have a virtual community or portal where teachers can submit lesson plans and have them reviewed by other teachers or school staff from anywhere in the country (or world) <br> <br> 

		- Problem #2: Literacy in a science classroom <br> <br> 

		All classrooms are reading classrooms, not just English classes. However, this can be a challenge when a teacher doesn't always know of texts (e.g. articles, stories, primary sources, etc.) that directly align with a particular objective or standard. It would be awesome to have something where I can search for articles and texts based on standards and learning goals. Further, it would be great to then be able to adjust the reading level of these texts to fit the needs of all of my students. <br> <br> 

		- Problem #3: Seating charts <br> <br> 

		So now that I have my lesson reviewed and my texts selected, I need to create my seating chart. This isn't as easy as it seems. I need to consider the ever-changing relationships between students, the dynamics they have with me, the physical needs they may have, and their various academic skill levels. If there were an algorithm or software to do this for me, I'd be the first in line. <br> <br> 

		<b style="font-size: 25px; color: #00accb;"> New Story (Health/Wellness Nonprofit)</b> <br> <br> 

		- Problem #1: Impact Data Platform <br> <br> 

		A tool to allow for New Story partners in Haiti, El Salvador, etc to send impact data and content on the homes and community we are building back to us in SF <br> <br>

		- Problem #2: Transparency Dashboard <br> <br> 

		A transparency dashboard where visitors and donors can see all New Story impact data, financial transaction data, etc. Basically opening up the New Story database to the public in a sense. <br> <br>

		- Problem #3: Open-sourced Code <br> <br> 

		Open sourcing the New Story code base so we can have anyone and everyone “be an engineer on our team” and code for us but also allow other nonprofits to build off our platform and also become transparent and tech powered. <br> <br>

		- Problem #4: Magical Donor Experience <br> <br> 

		Magical donor experience app. The idea is to connect our team to our donors immediately after they donate. Imagine getting a personal video from our team shortly after giving. <br> <br> 

		<b style="font-size: 25px; color: #00accb;"> RE-volv (Environmental Nonprofit)</b> <br> <br> 

		- Problem #1: Project Rating Algorithm <br> <br> 

		In this <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/10zU9-ap0IlInsraWvDvWxGxasjYOHsQvwjgr33YVmxE/viewform">survey</a>, you can see the questions that we ask potential Solar Champions about themselves and the community they wish to put solar on.

		Could we:
		<ul>
		<li>Build this questionnaire onto our website as opposed to having it be on a google form?</li>
		<li>Create an algorithm that rates each application based on the qualifications of the volunteer and the viability of the project?</li>
		</ul>
		This would likely require many iterations to perfect, but even a basic algorithm to help us weed out the less desirable projects would be beneficial. <br> <br>

		- Problem #2: Reinvestment Functionality <br> <br> 

		This is the most critical piece of functionality missing from our website and it needs to be corrected immediately. Here’s how it should work. Someone selects a project on the homepage and makes a donation. When that project i s completed and the solar project is built, RE-volv gets a monthly lease payment. A percentage of the person’s donation is returned in the form of a credit in their portfolio page every month. Every month the person gets a credit on the 1st of the month. They then have 15 days to select among the other projects on the site to decide which project to reinvest their credits in next. If after 15 days they have not selected a project to invest it in RE-volv will select where the money goes. If there is no project available on the site that month, then it accumulates in their account. <br> <br> 

		The code that was already developed to implement this functionality is in two parts <a href='https://www.dropbox.com/sh/yfym41ficnlo7np/AABu9xxvWXVlQvTmF4y8CD2Sa?dl=0'>here</a> and <a href='https://www.dropbox.com/sh/frbjjcjv8od155x/AABp22lxGm-vd3dtNFQDG487a?dl=0'>here</a>. Please use this code to build out the functionality on our new website and make whatever adjustments are needed to make it work best. <br> <br>
