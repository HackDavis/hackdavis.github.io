		Travel reimbursements will be handed out on a first-come first-serve basis to hackers who are admitted outside of UC Davis.
		<br> <br>
		To secure your reimbursement, you <u>must</u> confirm your attendence to the event on the typeform link in your acceptance email and check into the actual event. We will try to reimburse everyone, but reimbursements comes on a first-come first-serve basis. After submitting a project at HackDavis, send an email to <a href="mailto:hello@hackdavis.io"> hello@hackdavis.io</a> with the following:
		<br> <br> 
		
		<ul>
			<li> Your full name </li>
			<li> DevPost project submission link </li>
			<li> Mailing address </li>
			<li> An attachment of your itinerary/gas receipt to and from the event </li>
		</ul>

		<br>
		We will then mail out your reimbursement following the event. We will primarily be reimbursing through <a href="http://venmo.com">Venmo</a> so please have an account set up before then. Otherwise we will be distributing reimbursements through checks. 
		<br><br>

		<h2>Reimbursement Based on Distance</h2><br>
		We will be capping reimbursements based on distance.<br><br>
		<ul>
			<li> Sacramento: $10 maximum</li>
			<li> Bay Area: $25 maximum </li>
			<li> SoCal / farther than Bay Area: $50 maximum</li>
		</ul>
		<br>

		<h2>What About School Buses?</h2><br>
		Unfortunately, HackDavis is not in a position to offer buses to other universities this year. We will definitely be doing it next year as our hackathon scales up. 
		<br><br>
		<h2>Getting To The Event</h2><br>
		The event will be at the <b>ARC Ballrooms, 232 One Shields Avenue, Davis, CA 95616.</b><br>
		<b>Drive if you can!</b> It's generally a cheaper and more convenient option, particularly if a few hackers carpool together. We will pay for gas and parking is free.

		<br><br>
		<h2>Trains, Shuttles, and Buses</h2>
		Davis has an extensive student-run <a href="http://unitrans.ucdavis.edu">Unitrans Bus System</a> which you can use to navigate around Davis. You can also <a href="http://amtrak.com">Amtrak</a> to Davis as there is an Amtrak station downtown. If you are a Berkeley student, the Berkeley-Davis shuttle drops off on-campus.
		<br><br>
		<a href="mailto:hello@hackdavis.io"> Email us</a> if you have any further doubts. We look forward to seeing you there!
