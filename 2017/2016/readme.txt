The event that I chose to animate for this milestone is the location of the ball throughout a particular game. I loaded the data and looped it through the "Draw" function, which continually looks for the rows that represent the position of the ball. 

The slider represents the time in the game. As I move the slider, you can see where the ball is at that point in the game. The left side is towards the beginning of the game, while right side is towards the end. This is measured by the timer values in the data.
